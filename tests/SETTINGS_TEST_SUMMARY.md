### 2. Real Game Integration Test (`real-game-settings-integration-test.js`)
**Status: âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED (5/5 categories)**

Tests actual game behavior to ensure settings are truly respected:

- **Wild Card Skip Integration**: Tests wild card skip behavior in real game scenarios
- **UNO Challenges Integration**: Tests UNO challenge functionality in real games
- **Jump-In Integration**: Tests jump-in functionality in real games

### 3. Wild Card Skip Test (`wild-card-skip-test.js`)
**Status: âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED (5/5 categories)**

Specialized test for the new wild card skip feature:

- **No Skip (0)**: Verifies wild cards don't skip players
- **Next Player (1)**: Verifies wild cards move to next player normally
- **Skip Next (2)**: Verifies wild cards skip the next player (default behavior)
- **Skip Two (3)**: Verifies wild cards skip two players
- **Settings Persistence**: Verifies wild card skip setting persists correctly

### 4. Settings Persistence Test (`settings-persistence-test.js`)
**Status: âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED (2/2 categories)**

Tests the core settings persistence functionality:

- **Settings Persistence**: Tests localStorage save/load operations
- **Settings Validation**: Tests settings structure and value validation
